# Introduction
This repository contains the Python code that was written to complete a data science project, where the project's goal was to build a clustering model that groups cities globally into Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). More information about the project and the model can be found within the "code_for_project.ipynb" file itself. Note that this file is a Jupyter Notebook.

# Usage Instructions

At the request of the project's manager, the dataset that the "code_for_project.ipynb" file analyzes has been removed from public view. Therefore, the code cannot be run by a user. However, a user may view the code by first downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), installing the free [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), and opening the code file within Visual Studio Code.
